//>> Events in JAVASCRIPT

//HTML events are "things" that happen to html elements
// when js is used in HTML pages ,jjs can "react" on these events.

//HTML events
// an html event can be something the browser does or something a user does.

//Here are some examples of HTML events:


//An HTML web pages has finished loading 
//HTML input field was chagned
//HTML button was clicked
//often, when events happen you may want to do something

//js lets you execute code when events are detected
//HTML allows event handler attributes with js code


//4 ways of writing events in js

// 1: using alert()
// 2: by calling a function 
// 3: using inline EventS
// 4: using event listeners (add eventListner and IE attachevent)

//diff between onclick and addeventlister is 
//on onclick method the event will call only one time and in eventlistener the even we can call multiple times


//>>> what is event object?
//Event object is the parent object of the event object
//for example
//MouseEvent, focusEvent, KeyboardEvent etc

//>> Mouse Event in js 
//the mouseevent object 
//Events that occur when the mouse interacts with the HTML
//document belongs to the MouseEvent Object


//>>keyboard event in js
//Events that occure when user presses a key in keyboard
//belongs to the keybaordEvent Object

//input events in js
//the onchange event occures when the value of an element has been changed 
//for radio button and checkbox the onchange event occurs when the checked state has been changed




//the window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals.
//this time intervals are called timing events.
//the two key methods to use with js are:

//setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
//Execute a function after waiting  a specifid number of milisecodes.

//setInterval(function, milisecodes)
//same as setTimeout() but repeates the execution of the function continuously 

//setTimeout()
//clearTimeout()
//setInterval()
//clearIntervals()
